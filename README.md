bge_shortcuts
=============

A simple addon for the Blender Game Engine to make life slightly easier when developing or prototyping games. Add shaders (depth of field, SSAO, contrast...) or scripts (fly camera, first person rig...to scenes with the click of a button.

Installation
------------

[Download this addon](https://github.com/nickpolet/bge_shortcuts/archive/master.zip) and then place it into the scripts/addons folder for blender.

Once you have launched blender, open up the User Preferences (ctrl+alt+u) the open the 'Add-ons' tab. Start typing in 'bge_shortcuts' and you should see the addon appear. Click the checkbox to enable bge_shortcuts.

Great, all setup and ready to develop.


Useage
------

bge_shortcuts can be found in the 'Tool Shelf' (hotkey:T) under the 'Game Engine' tab. There are a number of buttons which add shaders/scripts/helpers to the scene. The buttons are quite self explanatory and you shouldn't have an issue figuring out what they do.

When you add a shader to the scene, an options button will appear next to the shader button. Clicking this opens up some options which you can change to alter how the shaders behave.

If you think something should be included, then open up an issue on github and explain it. I will do my best to add in something if it is suitable.
